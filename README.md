## 🤓 Overview and learning outcomes 

 🚀

## Circuit Setup

Import the file in this repository titled, "sample_circuit.txt" into the Circuit Simulator App.  You will use this circuit below on the "Next Steps" section.

## 💻 Terms to know

- Volts
- Amps
- Ohms
- Ohm's Law
- Ohm's Law Triangle

## 📝 Next steps

1. Create a markdown file titled, "results.md".
2. Complete the following steps and answer these questions in the results file (Show all calculations in your answers):
    - Hover over any point in the ciruit to get the voltage drop and current values for that part of the ciruit.  What is the total current (I<sub>T</sub>) for the circuit?
    - What is total resistance for the circuit (R<sub>T</sub>)?
    - Based on this answer, explain what the reistance is for the LED (R<sub>LED1</sub>)?
    - Use voltage drop for the LED to confirm your answer.  Was there a difference?  If so, why did this happen?
    - Change the color of the LED.  What changed about the R<sub>T</sub> value and voltage drop for the LED?  Explain what you think happened.
    - Generate a random number using the [Comprehensive Version on Calculator.net](https://www.calculator.net/random-number-generator.html?clower=3.5&cupper=9.5&cnums=1&cdup=y&csort=n&cnumt=d&cprec=2&ctype=2&s=52404.5677&submit1=Generate#comprehensive).  Set it as seen here:

   - Using your random number as the current in mA, given that voltage is set to 5V. 
3. Commit the file to submit.
